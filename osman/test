OSMAN;
HOW ARE YOU DOING? TONIGHT I RAN THE WEEKLY ASP FOR
D27, ANDN RAN ACROSS SOMETHING THAT CONFUSED ME. OUR NORMAL
ASP RUN IS AS FOLLOWS.
1. R TAKEIT AND BRING SYSTEM TO BOOTS.
2. BRING SYSTEM UP MANUAL AND LOGIN AS OPER,
   SETTING SCHEDULE TO 600000 AND VERIFYING THAT NO
   ONE ELSE IS ON SYSTEM, WE R DSKCLN, GIVING IT A
   MODE CODE OF 7.
3. AFTER DSKCLN COMPLETES, WE RUN ASP AND SAVE STRUCTURE.

Continuing.....

4. After the ASP save is complete, and successful,
   we simply Run CHKPNT, and re-login to Oper 
   setting status, RUN (UTIL)GOPJ and open system 
   up to schedule 000000.
5. What my concern is, that we never initiate the
   user: PERPOPER running XEXEC. 
6. Tonight what I did was to run TAKEIT, hang system,
   and bring it up normally (system did NOT force a
   DSKCLN (since TAKEIT had taken care of the SAT
   pages right?)
7. I guess what I'm asking is that we probably should
   change our procedures to insure XEXEC is running.

Something else you might like to know is that Paul Miller has run
the ASP through the CONSOLE mode sucessfully a few times, and in fact
feels it runs safer and better this way (safer meaning we are not
susceptible to TYMNET drops). He figures also that we save upwards
of 30 minutes running it this way.

Well, hope you had a nice weekend, I will be talking to Leland and
Ed concerning our conversation this monday afternoon.

Take care.....Jim English
