SUBJECT:  US POSTAL SERVICE IMMEDIATE ACTION ITEMS


-------------------------------------------------------------

        THE FOLLOWING LIST AND DISCUSSION INCLUDES THE TBA AND OTHER 
TYMCOM X DEVELOPEMENTS THAT ARE REQUIRED INORDER TO PROCEED ON
THE NATIONAL US POSTAL SERVICE CONVERSION.  I CAN NOT STRESS TOO 
HEAVILY THE IMPORTANCE OF IMMEDIATE ACTION ON THESE ITEMS.  WITH ONLY A
FEW EXCEPTIONS, ALL OF THE 40 USPS SYSTEMS UNDERGOING CONVERSION CANNOT
BE IMPLEMENTED WITHOUT SOLUTIONS TO THE ITEMS LISTED BELOW.  AS INDICATED,
WE DO HAVE ALTERNATIVES BUT MOST WILL BE PROHIBITIVELY EXPENSIVE ... MOSTLY
BECAUSE OF THE EXCESSIVE USE OF 'OPEN/CLOSE' STATEMENTS.

        FOR FINAL DETAILS ON EACH OF THE ITEMS, IT WILL BE
NECESSARY FOR YOU TO CONTACT DICK YODER OR JACK THOMAS OF SIMCON.  ALSO,
PLEASE REFER TO MY MEMOS

ITEM    IMPACT          DISCUSSION
----    ------------    ------------------------------------------------------
  1                     SIMULTANEOUS FILE ACCESS****

        SEVERE! MUST    SEE ATTACHMENT 'MULTI-UPDATE/READ ACCESS AND PAGES
        HAVE.           134 THRU 141 OF THE SBC BASIC MANUAL.  AS PER OUR
                        DISCUSSIONS AND YOUR MEMOS, WE MUST HAVE SOME TWO TO
                        FOUR WEEK SOLUTION THAT WILL ALLOW UP TO 23 USERS TO
                        SIMULTANEOUS UPDATE/READ THE SAME FILE WITHOUT CAUSEING
                        SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN CODEING OF THE TBA PROGRAMS AND
                        WHICH WILL NOT COST MORE THAN THE FINAL IMPLEMENTATION.
                        IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT A REASONABLY
                        GOOD SIMULTANEOUS ACCESS FUNCTION COULD BE IMPLIMENTED
                        QUICKLY BY UTILIZING ALREADY WRITTEN CODE FROM APL OR
                        MAGNUM AND/OR BY USE OF THE 'CLUB' FACILITY.

                        WHAT EVER IS USED, WE WILL NEED THE SYNTAX ASAP SO
                        THAT WE CAN MODIFY ALL THE CONVERTED PROGRAMS ACCORD-
                        INGLY.


  2                     MONITOR VARIABLES****
        COSTLY.
        USED THRUOUT    KNOWN AS 'CONDITION CODE VARIABLE' BY SBC, THEY ARE
                        AVAILABLE TO COMMAND FILES AND BASIC PROGRAMS TO
                        TRANSFER VALUES FROM PROGRAM TO PROGRAM INEXPEN-
                        SIVELY.  THESE VARIABLES ( CNC(1), CNC(2), CNC(3) )
                        CAN CONTAIN AN INTEGER FROM 0 TO 255 WITH INITIAL
                        VALUE SET TO 0.  THE VALUES CAN BE TESTED WITH A
                        'BASIC' COMPUTED GOTO AND AN 'IF' STATEMENT AND
                        CAN BE ASSIGNED LIKE ANY OTHER VARIABLE.  REFER TO
                        PAGES 83,84 AND 87 OR (SEQUENTIAL PAGES 4,5,6)
                        OF MY 2/20/80 MEMO ATTACHMENTS.

                        IN ADDITION, NEED AN ALPHAMERIC CONDITION
                        CODE VARIABLE (CN$) WHICH CAN CONTAIN UP TO 18 
                        CHARACTERS OF TEXT.  THIS IS ALSO DOCUMENTED IN THE
                        CALL/370 MANUAL PAGES REFERENCED ABOVE.

                        THE CURRENT ALTERNATIVES, USE OF TMP FILES TO PASS
                        THIS INFORMATION IS VERY EXPENSIVE.  THEREFORE, IT
                        WOULD BE NECESSARY TO DROP TRU'S IF WE HAD TO USE THIS
                        TECHNIQUE.


  3                     'RUN' OR LINKING FROM ORIGINATING PROGRAM TO ONE OR
                        MORE CALLED PROGRAMS OR PROCEDURES****

        COSTLY.         REFER TO PAGES 65THRU 71 OF THE SBC BASIC MANUAL.
        USED THRUOUT    THE 'COM' 'RUN P1,P2 .. WITH X' COMMAND CAN BE
                        IMPLEMENTED USING .TMP AND .SHR FILES AND LOADING OF
                        COMMON CODE INTO LOAD MODULES.  HOWEVER, THIS SOLUTION
                        IS FAR TO EXPENSIVE SINCE IT IS USED SUBSTANTIALLY.

                        THE ALTERNATIVE OF CREATING A COMMAND FILE AND PLACING
                        IT INTO AN INPUT BUFFER FOR LATER EXECUTION AS
                        PER SAMUEL FELDMAN'S SUGGESTION, WILL NEED TO BE
                        FULLY EXPLAINED AND IMPLEMENTED.


  4                     COMMAND EXEC FACILITY****
                        
        VERY LABOR      SBC MAKES HEAVY USE OF PROCEDURE FILES
        INTENSIVE       THAT CONTROL WHICH PROGRAMS WILL BE RUN,
        VERY COSTLY     WHAT SEQUENCE THEY WILL BE RUN IN, AND USE
                        THEM TO SUPPLY RESPONSES TO PROGRAM PROMPTS.
                        WITHOUT A COMPARABLE COMMAND FACILITY THAT WILL
                        ALLOW, AT A MINIMUM, THE CAPABILITY TO CHECK
                        RETURN CODES, BRANCH TO A DIFFERENT PART OF
                        THE COMMAND FILES AND TO CALL PROGRAM PROMPTS,
                        SIMCON WILL HAVE TO WRITE A TYMBASIC PROGRAM
                        TO REPLACE EACH PROCEDURE FILE.  CURRENTLY,
                        THERE ARE 87 PROCEDURE FILES IN THE
                        CONVERSION, BY UTILIZING PROGRAMS TO REPLACE
                        THE PROCEDURE FILES, WE WILL BE LIMITING THE
                        FLEXIBILITY OF THE USPS USERS.  THIS IS
                        CAUSED BY FORCING THE USER TO:

                        1.  HAVE TO RUN THE DRIVER SOFTWARE EVERY 
                            TIME HE GOES INTO THE SYSTEM AS OPPOSED TO
                            RUNNING INDIVIDUAL PROGRAMS, OR

                        2.  EVERY PROGRAM IN THE SYSTEM WILL HAVE TO BE
                            MODIFIED TO PROMPT THE USER AS TO WHETHER
                            OR NOT HE WISHES TO GO BACK TO THE DRIVER
                            PROGRAM.

                        AS CAN BE SEEN BY ALL OF THE OPTIONS ABOVE,
                        THE ADDITIONAL PROGRAMMING IS OF SOME MAGNITUDE,
                        AND THE COST TO USPS WOULD GO UP FOR EVERY
                        SYSTEM FROM THE STANDPOINT OF HAVING TO RUN A
                        PROGRAM AS OPPOSED TO MONITOR COMMANDS.








  5     VERY LABOR      FREE FORM , SPACE DELIMITED I/O****
        INTENSIVE
                        SBC MAKES HEAVY USE OF SOURCE FILE INPUT WITH SPACE
                        DELIMETERS.  WE CAN SOLVE THE PROBLEM BY CHANGING
                        THESE FILES TO BINARY SINCE THEY ARE NOT READ BY
                        THE USERS FOR EDITING OR PRINTING.  HOWEVER, THEY
                        MUST ALSO BE SORTED.. SOMETHING THAT WE UNDERSTANT
                        CAN'T BE DONE SINCE THE FILES ARE VARIABLE LENGTH.

                        THEREFORE, WE NEED A FUNCTION TO READ SPACE DELIMITED
                        FREEFORM TYPE FILES OR A METHOD TO SORT BINARY
                        VARIABLE LENGTH FILES (THIS WOULD BE PREFERRED SINCE
                        IT WOULD PROBABLY BE THE MOST EFFICIENT METHOD) .


  6     LABOR INTEN-    ON DIV BY ZERO 'THEN N' CAPEABLITY****

        SIVE.           

                        THE ALTERNATIVE DUAL STATEMENT APPROACH, I.E. ON
                        MATH GOTO N FOLLOWED BY A CHECK FOR DIV. BY ZERO
                        WILL REQUIRE PROGRAMMING IN MANY SYSTEM AND THUS
                        WILL INCREASE POTENTIAL FOR PROGRAM BUGS.

                        SINCE THE 'THEN N' PART OF THE 'ON DIV BY ZERO
                        COULD PERHAPS BE ADDED QUICKLY, WE WISH TO GO THAT
                        DIRECTION TO AVOID EXCESSIVE CONVERSION ACTIVITY.


  7     DELAYS BY SIM-  NEED ASSISTANCE IN USE OF DDT****
        CON

  8     DELAYS BY SIM-  NEED INTERNAL TBA DOC. ON DATA FILES****
        CON
                        NEED COMPLETE SET OF INTERNAL DOCUMENTATION AS TO
                        HOW TYMBASIC HANDLES FILES INTERNALLY.. I.E. THE
                        FORM COMMANDS, LOCATE, POS, ETC.  THIS WILL GIVE
                        SIMCON AN IDEA AS TO HOW TO CREATE A CORRECT FORM
                        STATEMENT EVERY TIME.


  9     CAN'T COM-      TERMINAL PLOTTING CALLABLE FROM TBA****
        PLETE ONE SYSTEM
                        PER CONVERSATION WITH KEN HOLKOMB, UNDERSTAND THAT
                        STATPACK PLOTTING AS ON THE IX MIGHT BE AVAILABLE
                        ON THE X.  IN ADDITION, UNDERSTAND THAT PICTURE-
                        PACK IS BEING LOOKED AT.  WE MUST HAVE SOME TERMINAL 
                        PLOTTING CAPABILITY ON THE X IN ORDER TO IMPLEMENT ONE
                        OF THE SBC SYSTEMS.  


 10     NEWLY FOUND     INPUT/ESCAPE PROBLEM****
        TBA BUG
                        TBA PROGRAM WILL NOT ALLOW USER TO ESCAPE DURING
                        A PROMPT FOR INPUT DURING THE SECOND OR LATER PROMPT.

                        AN EXAMPLE EXISTS ON SYSTEM 39 - FILE NAMED
                        (CONPS9)RI0002.TBA .  MORE DETAILS CAN BE GATHERED
                        FROM JACK THOMAS OF SIMCON.  ACTUAL IMPACT CAN BE
                        SIGNIFICANT.

FROM: JACK THOMAS

SUBJECT: MULTI FILE ACCESS


                        MULTI-UPDATE/READ ACCESS



     THE MULTI FILE  ACCESS  ON  THE  DEC-10  TO  ALLOW  FOR
SIMULTANEOUS  FILE  ACCESS  BOTH IN THE READ AND UPDATE MODE
SHOULD BE IMPLEMENTED IN SOME FORM OF THE FOLLOWING.

     ON THE DEC-10 THE EASIEST METHOD WOULD  BE  TO  LOCK  A
USER  BASED ON A PAGE OF DATA AS OPPOSED TO RECORD OR FIELD.
IF A USER 'TOUCHES' A RECORD IN A PAGE THAT SPANS PAGES THEN
BOTH  PAGES 'TOUCHED' SHOULD BE LOCKED OUT.  A PAGE(S) WOULD
STAY LOCKED OUT UNTIL ANOTHER WRITE OR READ IS DONE  ON  THE
FILE,  OR  THE PROGRAM ENDS EXECUTION, OR THE USER IS LOGGED
OFF.  IF THE USER IS DISCONNECTED FROM THE SYSTEM AND IS  IN
DISCONNECT  MODE,  THE SYSTEM SHOULD REMEMBER WHERE THE USER
WAS IN THE FILE AND IF  CONTINUED  AFTER  DISCONNECT  SHOULD
REACCESS  (I.E.  REREAD) THAT(THOSE) PAGE(S) AND RELOCK.  IF
THE PAGES ARE NOW IN USE, THE PROGRAM SHOULD GO INTO A  WAIT
STATE FOR FREE.

     THE COMMAND TO OPEN A FILE IN SUCH A MODE WOULD IDEALLY
BE  SOMETHING  LIKE  'SOPEN  .......'.   ANOTHER POSSIBILITY
WOULD BE A 'SIMUL' OPTION WITHIN THE  OPEN.   'SIMUL'  WOULD
ONLY  MEAN  SOMETHING  IF  THE  FILE  WAS  ALSO  OPENED  FOR
'RANDOUT' OR 'RANDIO' OTHERWISE THE 'SIMUL' OPTION WOULD  BE
IGNORED.  THE SAME LOGIC WOULD APPLY IN THE 'SOPEN'.  

     THESE FEATURES SHOULD OPERATE ON THE SAME LINE  AS  ALL
OPENS  IF  THE USER HAS ACCESS TO OTHER DIRECTORIES (THROUGH
THE 'RPG'??) IN THAT IT WILL AUTOMATICALLY SEARCH  THE  USER
NAME   SEQUENCE   SPECIFIED   AND,  IF  IT  IS  FOUND,  WILL
READ/UPDATE IN THE PROPER USER NAME DIRECTORY.



          THANKS,
          JACK
